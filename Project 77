                <p> Microsoft Visual Studio is an integrated development
                 environment (IDE) from Microsoft. It is used to develop 
                 computer programs, as well as websites, web apps, web 
                 services and mobile apps. ... Visual Studio includes a
                  code editor supporting IntelliSense (the code completion
                   component) as well as code refactoring.</p>

                   <p> A console is the combination of a monitor and 
                   keyboard. It is a rudimentary interface in which
                    the monitor provides the output and the keyboard 
                    is used for input. While any computer with a 
                    monitor and keyboard may be considered a console,
                     the term most often refers to a system used to 
                     control one or more servers.</p>
